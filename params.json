These transactions include:\r\n\r\n- Pre-Authorizations, where the available balance is checked if sufficient and then modified, but the purchase is not completed.\r\n- Purchase, where the previously-authorized purchase is completed\r\n- Transfer, where a balance transfer is made between two cards.\r\n\r\nThe code is divided into two projects.  Under the \"db\" directory is the database project, which contains the schema, stored procedures and other configurations that are compiled into a catalog and run in a VoltDB database.  Under the \"client\" directory is a java client that loads a set of cards and then generates random card transactions a high velocity to simulate card activity.\r\n\r\nSee below for instructions on running these applications.  For any questions, \r\nplease contact fieldengineering@voltdb.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nDatabase application\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe database application must be started first.  It can be run from the command line\r\nor the catalog file can be deployed using VoltDB Enterprise Manager which is\r\nprovided with VoltDB Enterprise Edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo build and run the database application:\r\n\r\n    cd db\r\n    ./run.sh\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can just compile or build the catalog with the following commands\r\n\r\n    ./run.sh srccompile\r\n    ./run.sh catalog\r\n\r\nYou can remove the compiled code with:\r\n\r\n    ./run.sh clean\r\n\r\nTo configure for more than 1 node, edit the deployment.xml file.  Basic instructions\r\nare in Using VoltDB, Section 6.1, and all the options for the deploymen file are described\r\nin Appendix D.\r\n\r\n\r\nClient application\r\n------------------\r\nTo build and run the database application:\r\n  \r\n    cd client\r\n    ./run.sh\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can just compile with the following commands\r\n\r\n    ./run.sh srccompile\r\n\r\nYou can run the benchmark with:\r\n\r\n    ./run.sh benchmark\r\n\r\nYou may want to edit the parameters for the benchmark.  To do this, edit the run.sh file, under\r\nthe section \"function benchmark()\".\r\n\r\nYou can remove the compiled code with:\r\n\r\n    ./run.sh clean\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
